### Development

I leveraged handlebars heavily in this project, I wanted to pull out all the stops and create well polished looking application. For the front end I committed to not using JQuery or Bootstrap. I did decide to try out Bulma css for this project. I also wanted to dive heavily into writing unit tests for the application as well.
