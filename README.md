### Development

I leveraged handlebars heavily in this project, I wanted to pull out all the stops and create well polished looking application. For the front end I committed to not using JQuery or Bootstrap. I also wanted to dive heavily into writing unit tests for the application as well.

I tried bulma for this project however I found it clunky and missing features. I decided to switch to materialize as it is more popular and has better documentation.

I was going to use a login system but decided to keep it anonymous, I just use a function to define random names.
